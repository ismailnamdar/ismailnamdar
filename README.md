### Hi, I'm Ismail 👋

I love making things!

- 🌐 I’m currently working on developing web applications mostly with react.
- My experience:
  * `Migrated web application` written with angularjs to react
  * Created `dynamic dashboards`
  * `Led` a small team
  * Created simple `formula language syntax` with `nearley`
  * Created internal `react library`
  * Created an architectire to use `canvas` with react state
  * Created a small extension for web `accessibility`
  * Created a bunch of internal `nodejs` services
  * Created a bunch of mobile applications with `react-native`/`expo` and also created iOS apps with `swift`
